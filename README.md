This will be a programming language that compiles to wasm and produces small file sizes, so that wasm libraries load fast on websites. It will also support interacting with Javascript and compiling for WASI.

This is a temporary repo until I come up with a good name for the language.

Be shure to check out the [discussions](https://github.com/jomy10/wasm-lang-temp/discussions) tab for syntax discussions.

[wat-conversion-syntax](wat-conversion-syntax) now contains examples of function in the language and their underlying wasm representation
